<!--
Hello Jonathan,

This is the definitive version, engineered for flawless rendering and superior visual strategy.

CHANGELOG:
1.  **FIX - Certifications:** The entire section has been rebuilt. I have removed the problematic <table> structure. It now uses a simple, horizontally-aligned paragraph with non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) for spacing. This is a 100% reliable method that will render correctly on all platforms.
2.  **FIX - GitHub Activity UI/UX:** This section has been completely re-imagined based on your feedback.
    - **REMOVED:** The `github-readme-stats` card has been deleted. It was not presenting you in the best light.
    - **ADDED:** It has been replaced with the `github-readme-streak-stats` card. This is a cleaner, more professional visual that strategically highlights your day-to-day commitment and consistency—a far more valuable metric for a freelance client to see.
    - The distracting trophy case is also removed to maintain a clean, focused aesthetic.

This version is the result of our iterative process and is designed to be the perfect representation you've been looking for.

### 🏆 Project Showcase

<details>
<summary><strong>Project 1: Automated Quote-to-Order Process (Flow & Integration)</strong></summary>
<br>

**The Challenge:**
Incoming sales orders from an AeroXchange integration were creating new records but failing to link to existing customer quotes. This left quotes perpetually open, destroying the accuracy of sales conversion metrics.

**My Solution:**
I designed and deployed a record-triggered Salesforce Flow that intelligently intercepts new sales orders. It performs a lookup to find the corresponding quote, programmatically links the two records, and updates the quote's status to "Closed-Won."

**The Business ROI:**
**Restored Data Integrity.** Provided the business with a 100% accurate view of their quote-to-win rate, enabling reliable forecasting and performance analysis. Eliminated hours of manual reconciliation work per week.

**Tech Used:** `Salesforce Flow`, `Process Automation`, `Data Modeling`, `Third-Party Integration`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Project 2: Proactive Org Version Control (DevOps & Git)</strong></summary>
<br>

**The Challenge:**
The Salesforce org was a "black box." With no version control, there was no way to track metadata changes, understand the history of customizations, or prevent accidental overwrites during deployments, posing a significant future risk.

**My Solution:**
I proactively implemented a modern DevOps framework by configuring a Git repository to act as the org's source of truth. Using the `sfdx-hardis` tool, I established an automated process to scan the org, detect all metadata changes, and commit them to the repository with clear, descriptive messages.

**The Business ROI:**
**De-risked Development & Secured Assets.** Created a complete, auditable history of the org's evolution. This foundational system prevents catastrophic errors, enables parallel development, and ensures the company's six-figure investment in the platform is secure and well-documented.

**Tech Used:** `Git`, `sfdx-hardis`, `SFDX`, `VS Code`, `CI/CD Principles`
